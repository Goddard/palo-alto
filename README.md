# palo-alto
Repository dedicated to Palo Alto scripts

Currently a respoitory with one script for managing certain aspects of the Palo Alto firewall.  It is very cumbersome to create a VPN tunnel using the web interface and doing it via the commandline is not intuitive or fast.  This smooths out those wrinkles a bit.

If you have a script to add please submit it.
